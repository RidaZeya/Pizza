My recipe is about how to make pizza. 
Pizza is a dish of Italian origin, consisting of a flat round base of dough baked with a topping of tomatoes and cheese, typically with added meat, fish, or vegetables.

To make a Pizza you need:
Dough
Cheese
Sauce
Oven
Rolling Pin
any vegetables or toppings
Pizza cutter or knife

Firstly, you roll the dough with the rolling pin and make it into a circular shape.
Then, put the cheese, sauce, and any toppings on the pizza base.
Put the uncooked pizza in the oven and wait about 10-15 minutes until it cooks fully.
Take the pizza out carefully from the oven once cooked.
Use the pizza cutter or knife to serve the pizza.
Enjoy your pizza!
